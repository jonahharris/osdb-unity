========
Two new user supplied commands have been included in the Exptools UNITY
package:  un2html is used to print an HTML table from a unity data
base, and un2tbl is used to print a table in tbl form for a troff
(or groff) document.

========
UNITY is a small relational data  base  management  system (DBMS)  that  
runs  under  the  UNIX(TM) operating system.  UNITY is very user-oriented  
and  provides  many  powerful command  capabilities.   Emphasis is placed 
on ease of use and allowing a multi-user environment while keeping  UNITY
small and simple to understand and maintain.

It has become extremely popular within the AT&T/Lucent community due to its
power and flexibility.  Many common tasks can be done with supplied commands,
and the flat file database structure allows easy manipulation by other
tools for specific purposes.

For a general overview of UNITY, see

UNITY is now available in World-Wide Exptools, with a home page of
