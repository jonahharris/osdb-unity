02/05/04
========
Two new user supplied commands have been included in the Exptools UNITY
package:  un2html is used to print an HTML table from a unity data
base, and un2tbl is used to print a table in tbl form for a troff
(or groff) document.

08/10/04
========
Add a user-supplied patch to allow improved formatting in uprint and
prtable.  If the UNITY_PRT is set to "in1space=y", then fields will be
indented rather than being printed right up next to the field separator.
If UNITY_PRT is not set, then there should be no change in the operation
of these commands.

06/11/03
========
Rebuilt using gcc-3.3 on solaris and ilinux.  Should be no changes 
in functionality, even though several functions had to be re-written
to use stdarg.h instead of varargs.h

03/07/03
========
Ported to isolaris

08/02/01
========
Unity has been updated with several bugfixes and enhancments from Gerry
Graesser.  The most visible change is that the join, format, display, and
dis commands, as those names conflict with standard Unix commands.   The
alternate names ujoin, uformat, udisplay, and udis have been available for
some time and the commands are still present under those names.

=============== New Unity / Unity Release Notes ==================

BUG FIXES

This is not an inclusive list, but hits some of the important ones.

- Y2K compliancy, both internally and in date comparisons
  A date can have a four-digit year, or a two-digit year is
  interpreted by the window method.

- retrieve -F will return an error code if qprintf fails.

- on Solaris, regular expressions that contain character classes
  (e.g. [a-z] - these are generated internally for caseless comparisons)
  now work correctly.  (This was a bug in the Solaris regular expression
  routines.)

NEW FEATURES

1) Y2K compliant date comparisons.

2) Many more features in date comparisons.  There are several
   new date formats recognized, and dates can include times now.

3) Maximum record size (in old unity commands) and attribute size
   (in all commands) is now 16K on Solaris machines.

4) There is a new command called usort which is an extension of
   the asort (attribute sort) command.  usort allows sorting on
   multiple attributes, and has many options for controlling
   the sorting order and method of comparing fields.

5) udisplay/udis are synonyms for display/dis command

6) ninsert includes new options:
	-z do not include zero-print-width attribute unless
		explicitly listed
	-f/-F control the precision of rec#/REC# (the input record
		number/output record number) pseudo-attribute

7) "old" unity commands now recognize the UNITYUNPACK environment
   variable, which tells them how to recognize and unpack compressed
   relations

8) the catalog command has new options:
	-o page offset
	-v use verbose (friendly) attribute names
