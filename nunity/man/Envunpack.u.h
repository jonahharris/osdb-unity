UNITYUNPACK
A string of the form "command.suffix" where "command" is the the name of
a command that can be used to read (cat) the contents of a packed relation (file)
and "suffix" is the 1-3 character suffix (without the '.') that is appended to
the filename when the file has been packed (compressed).
Typical values for UNITYUNPACK are "pcat.z", "zcat.Z", and "gzcat.gz".
.IP
It should be noted that packed relations are not allowed as the target
of any type of insert, update, or delete operation.
In addition, using packed relations prevents the use of attribute indexes
and also prevents any packed tuples from being validated, see validate(UNITY).
See the setunpackenv(3) manual page for more information.
